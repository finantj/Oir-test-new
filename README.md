3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the development server.
- `npm run build` – build the production application.
- `npm run start` – run the built application.
- `npm run lint` – lint the codebase with ESLint.

## UI toolkit
