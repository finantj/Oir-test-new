            "dc:description": "A heavy and terrible shower fell in part of Connacht this year, that is, in Tir Maine and in Sodain and in Ui Diarmata and in Clann Taidc, which brought about disease and very great sickness among the cows and beasts of those regions after they had eaten grass and leaves; and when men drank of the milk of these cattle and ate of their flesh, they suffered internal pains and various diseases. Nor was it strange that these portentous things should happen in Connacht at that time, for a great affliction befell the country then, the loss of Cathal Crobderg son of Toirrdelbach O Conchobair, king of Connacht; the king most feared and dreaded on every hand in Ireland; the king who carried out most plunderings and burnings against Galls and Gaels who opposed him; the king who was the fiercest and harshest towards his enemies that ever lived; the king who most blinded, killed and mutilated rebellious and disaffected subjects; the king who best established peace and tranquility of all the kings of Ireland; the king who built most monasteries and houses for religious communities; the king who most comforted clerks and poor men with food and fire on the floor of his own habitation; the king whom of all the kings in Ireland God made most perfect in every good quality; the king on whom God most bestowed fruit and increase and crops; the king who was most chaste of all the kings of Ireland; the king who kept himself to one consort and practised continence before God from her death till his own; the king whose wealth was partaken by laymen and clerics, infirm men, women and helpless folk, as had been prophesied in the writings and the visions of saints and righteous men of  p.5 old; the king who suffered most mischances in his reign, but God raised him up from each in turn; the king who with manly valour and by the strength of his hand preserved his kingship and rule. And it is in the time of this king that tithes were first levied for God in Ireland. This righteous and upright king, this prudent, pious, just champion, died in the robe of a Grey Monk, after a victory over the world and the devil, in the monastery of Knockmoy, which with the land belonging to it he had himself offered to God and the monks, on the twenty-seventh day of May as regards the solar month and on a Monday as regards the week-day, and was nobly and honourably buried, having been for six and thirty years sole monarch of the province of Connacht. So says Donnchad Baccach O Maelchonaire in his poem on the Succession of the Kings: “The reign of Red-hand was a pleasant reign, after the fall of Cathal Carrach; he ruled for sixteen and twenty prosperous calm years.” And he was in the seventy-second year of his age, as the poet Nede O Maelchonaire says: “Three years and a half-year, I say, was the life of Red-hand in Cruachu till the time that his father died in wide-stretching Ireland.” He was born at Port Locha Mesca and fostered by Tadc O Con Chennainn in Ui Diarmata, and it was sixty-eight years from the death of Toirrdelbach to the death of Cathal Crobderg, as the chronicle shows.",

At this juncture the son of Magnus parted from the sons of Ruaidri and went into Tirawley to look for his cattle and people.

They came that night to Droichet Ingine Goilin (G's. Daughter's Bridge) and there daylight found them. Then Mac William asked: “Is there any path to the west, between us and the lake, by which any Connachtman might pass on their way northwards?” The guides answered: “Surely there is.” He put his horseman in order about Cong and Inishmaine, and at that moment there arrived a party of Connachtmen who had left Cong early, having been brought across the night before, three and five at a time, in imprudent and careless fashion. A few of [their] good men were [now] killed, including some officers of Magnus son of Muirchertach O Conchobair: Diarmait O hEidnechain, Lochlainn Mac Clesan and Tadc son of Gilla Crist O Mailbrenainn.",

And as he was not present, the common soldiers of the host burned the huts and tents which were inside the church, without permission of their leaders, and the coarb's foster-child, God's gift, was suffocated. Now learned men relate that the coarb received this foster-child by finding him on a large stone which stood in that place, and [the people] never knew of his having either mother or father; and the coarb loved him and gave him, as it is said, milk from his own breasts. Next day he came to them in anger and indignation at the death of the boy, requiring O Conchobair to pay the blood-fine for his foster-child, and O Conchobair said he could choose what fine he pleased. “I choose” said he “the best man among you, as compensation for the child of God whom you have burnt.” “That” said O Conchobair “is Magnus, the son of Muirchertach Muimnech.” “Nay, not so,” said Magnus “but he who is leader of the host.” “I will not go from you so” said the coarb “until I get the fine for my foster-child.” After this the host departed from that place, and the coarb followed them to Ath na Cuirre on the Yellow River, which was flowing over its banks, so that they could not cross it till they broke up the spital-house of John the Baptist, which stood beside the ford, and used its materials  p.83 to bridge the river for the host to pass across. Magnus son of Muirchertach Muimnech and Conchobar son of Cormac Mac Diarmata went into the house, and Magnus spoke to a man who was above him, at work on the house-breaking; “That” said he, pointing upwards with the chape of his sword, “is the nail which keeps the house from falling.” As he spoke, a rafter(?) fell on his head and smashed it to pieces on the spot. He was buried outside the doorway of the church of Fenagh, and thrice the full of the Bell of the Kings of silver and thirty horses were given as an offering with him. Thus, then, did the coarb of St. Caillin at last recover compensation for his fosterling of God from them. A beautiful monument of carved stone with an excellently wrought stone cross was afterwards made [and set up] over him, but after a while the Ui Ruairc in their enmity demolished it.",

O Domnaill mustered the Cenel Conaill and Cenel Eogain to oppose them at Ballyshannon and for a week exactly they did not let Gall or Gael pass the ford. So the invaders took counsel and sent Cormac O Conchobair with a large force of horsemen westwards along the plain and then southwards to the edge of the Mointech. From here he skirted the Mointech eastwards till he reached Ballycooloon on the Erne, and the Cenel Conaill perceived nothing of them till they saw them approaching on their own side of the river. But when the Galls saw the attention of the Cenel Conaill diverted from themselves to the horsemen who were taking them in their rear, they charged across the ford, so that the Cenel Conaill were between the two parties. And this is not all, for Maelsechlainn O Domnaill, king of Cenel Conaill, was killed there, and Gilla Muinelach O Baigill and Mac Somurli, king of Argyle, and all the chief men of Cenel Conaill. Many men of Mac Gerailt's army were drowned in crossing the Find northwards; many also were killed at Termon Magrath in the pursuit after the preys, including William Brit the Sheriff of Connacht and his brother, a young famous knight.

They came to Mayo and Balla and passed through Leyney, which they plundered on all sides, to Achonry; and from there they sent messengers to the Ui Raigillig, bidding them to come and meet them at Cros Dairi Cain at the eastern end of the Brauslieve mountains in Tir Thuathail. The Ui Raigillig came to Clachan Mucada on Slieve Anierin, but turned back from there, not having effected a meeting with the Galls, and came to Soltin Gasain. And on that same day—a friday, and the feast of Crosses in fact—Conchobar son of Tigernan O Ruairc mustered the men of Brefne and Conmaicne and all whom he could get, including Aed son of Fedlim O Conchobair and the chiefs of the Sil Murray and the rest of the men of Connacht. Now these are the best men that were with him:—Conchobair son of Tigernan O Ruairc king of Brefne, Cathal O Flaithbertaig, Murchad Finn O Fergail, Ruad in Feda O Flainn, Flann Mag Oirechtaig and Donn Oc, O Cellaig, the three sons of Mac Diarmata, Diarmait O Flannacain, Cathal son of Duarcan O hEgra, the two sons of Tigernan O Conchobair and Gilla na Naem O Taidc. But there were many of the youth of Connacht there besides these. The van of this host came upon the Ui Raigillig at Sailten Gassan and pursued them to Alt Tige Meg Currin. Here the new levies of the Muinter Raigillig turned upon this joint force and broke them thrice. The main army  p.117 came up with them after [some of] their men had been killed: Diarmait O Flannacain, Mac Maenaig, Coiclid O Coiclid and a number of others; and the combined armies came to Alt na hElti and Doirin Cranncha, between Ath na Betige and Bel in Belaig and Coill Esa and Coill Airthir, on Slieve Anierin. And here the Muinter Raigillig turned hardily, eagerly, wildly, strenuously, irrepressibly, to attack Fedlim's son and to avenge their injuries and oppression on him, and each chieftain exhorted his followers to go against the Connacht army.",

A fierce furious felling fight was joined then between the two hosts, many were killed and wounded on either side: Conchobar son of Tigernan [O Ruairc] king of Brefne, Murchad Finn O Fergail, Maelruanaid Mac Donnchada and many others were wounded on that field and some of them, among whom was Murchad O Fergail, died of their wounds at home; while Flann Mag Oirechtaig was killed in the recoil of the battle, and many more with him. However, those who have knowledge of this great battle relate that the warriors of the host on that field could not look in the face of the high lord, for two great wideglancing torches were flaming and flashing in his head, so that all feared to speak with him; for he was within hailing-distance in front of the armies as they approached the forces of the Ui Briuin; and he uttered his high-king's war-cry and his champion's shout in the midst of the fight and never stopped on that charge and onset until the ranks of the Ui Briuin were scattered.",

When Feidlim heard of these great feats he set off, with a few of his officers, to join the sons of Domnall son of Tadc O Conchobair, namely Ruaidri and Magnus, Cathal and Muirchertach, Donnchad and Seon and all their kinsmen. And on finding them loyal he made great raids, first on Brian O Dubda and then in Airtech, on Diarmait Gall Mac Diarmata, killing many of his men and burning his corn and houses, and another immediately afterwards on the sons of Cathal O Flannacain. The route by which this prey was taken was towards Cara Chula Cuirc, and it was not possible to drive it for the softness of the bog and for the numbers and force of the pursuing party; for it was caught up by the flower of the young soldiers of the Tuatha and the flower of the Clann Chathail and Mathgamain Mag Ragnaill, chieftain of the Muinter Eolais, with his kinsmen and his levies. Now when Mac Diarmata perceived the disorder of the prey on the way to the Cara (Weir), he followed its tracks to Coll Bathar, where he saw that it had been saved and detained. Now that was not what he wished for, but that it should not be left in the hands of its masters; and he glanced wrathfully and banefully at his enemies, holding them in contempt and scorn, though his following was but small compared with them and though he saw the wide flashing fiery throng prepared to crush him in the fight. However, on that field were killed Conchobar p.239 Ruad son of Aed Brefnech O Conchobair, Mathgamain Mag Ragnaill, chieftain of the Muinter Eolais, O Mailmiadaig, chieftain of the Muinter Cerballain, and many nobles of the Muinter Eolais; and he routed every company which was holding back his booty from Feidlim and carried off the prey himself and did not restore it to its lords. That night he reached the Boyle and next day passed northwestwards over the Curlieus to Coolavin and right through Coran into Leyney, where Feidlim with his company was awaiting him.",

General war and great evil arose in Connacht then, and the Clan Murtagh, with Aed son of Aed Brefnech and Cathal son of Aed Brefnech and Tadc son of Ruaidri, rose up on their side and began by destroying many of the corn-crops of the country.",

His friends advised him to go to Mac Diarmata's house by night and the Clan Murtagh, getting notice of this plan, made ready to intercept him on the roads and hazardous openings on the way to the stronghold; but he went past them in the pitchblack night with two or three horsemen. He was attacked on the causeway of the stronghold but cut his way through with the strength of his hand, wounding Cathal son of Aed Brefnech. Mac Diarmata had no knowledge of this till he heard the sound of cursing and the cries of distress approaching him in the stronghold. He rose up quickly and rescued O Conchobair and sent men of trust to escort him to the Rock, where he remained the best part of a week and was visited daily by the great men of the land.

But “no wrong goes unpunished and no deed unavenged,” and even so these deeds did not go without the swift vengeance of the Cenel Conaill. For this was the outcome of these deeds for them: O Neill's son was left at the end of the day with a few followers, guarding the rear of a prey which he had taken from Enri O Gairmlegaid, and these preys were taken from him by the Cenel Moan—though he was a success with failure for the Cenel Moan, since he killed the son of O Gairmlegaid with one sword-stroke; and after this the Cenel Conaill all closed round him and the slaying of this stout warrior was Toirrdelbach O Domnaill's to boast. Niall son of Niall Garb O Domnaill and Maelsechlainn son of Flaithbertach O Ruairc were killed by the Cenel Eogain in the early part of the day, and [the Cenel Conaill side] lost many another besides these; but they cannot all be enumerated, for fear of becoming tedious.",

And at Loch Labain in Airtech Mac Diarmata was hard put to it by O Conchobair Donn, the posterity of Muirchertach Muimnech O Conchobair, the sons of Fergal Mac Diarmata, the people of Airtech themselves, the Clann Ceithernaig and the Clann Conchobair. When this excessive body of foes found Mac Diarmata at a disadvantage they made a headlong rush at him, being two or three times as strong as he. They attacked him on two sides (?) and the drovers of O Conchobair, afoot and mounted, charged against him, and each party shot off the volley which was ready in their bows. But Mac Diarmata, with the support of Donnchad Mac Domnaill his constable, Lochlainn Colach Mac Caba and all the new levies of Moylurg, defeated this mingled host of enemies at the beginning p.395 of the day and his men made great slaughter of the rabble. Yet at the end this was a success with failure for Mac Diarmata's people. For some man of the opposing (?) battle sent a woful arrow-shot among the mighty mass of the nobles of the host who were protecting their prince and guarding him from the harm of the slaying; and this arrow passed by the worthless rabble-rout and mean folk and the chief champions of the fight entirely, but the [? point of] the black infernal dart pierced the nape of the prince in sight of all. However, after this irreparable loss, this immitigable misfortune to the free peoples of Sliab Segsa and the warriors of Cnoc in Scail and Tulchan Mailruanaid Moir, which everyone now calls [ {⬌}. . . ], as the poet Mac Coissi says: “Cnoc in Scail was its name at first, from the time of Nera it was his dwelling; the Mound of Maelruanaid of the spearpoints shall be its name until the end of time,” they departed from the country and came to their homes. Tadc was taken to be buried in the tomb of his ancestors, and after the burial of Tadc they made Ruaidri son of Aed Mac Diarmata king, and on my word this was not “a stone for an egg.” This great killing was done on the feast of Crosses, as the chronicler tells us.",

These two armies both went into Upper Geashill, and the Abbots' son proceeded with his own force to Cluain Immorrais, to the house of Gilla Buide Mac Maelcorra; and on my word it would have been better for them if they had not. For there Calbach the son of Murchad O Conchobair and Cathal [Dub] O Conchobair with six horsemen came upon them, and Gilla Buide, seeing Calbach's cauldron, which he had borrowed for making ale, on the back of a youth of the army, said: “I give you notice of your cauldron, Calbach!” “I accept it!” said Calbach. One of the pursuers threw a stone with sure aim, so that it struck the bottom of the cauldron, and this caused the army to take to flight. Not only was the Abbot's son killed on the moor to the north of that house, but their loss in men was not less than three hundred between that spot and Cloonany in Crinegedach, as we hear it generally reported. For this slaughtering was kept up from Cluain Immorrais to Cloonany and the most valued relic of all Connacht was taken from them that day, the “Buacach” of Patrick which used to be at Elphin. On the sixth of the Ides of July according to the day of the solar month, and on a Saturday according to the day of the week these things were done, that is to say, on the tenth day of the month of July.",

This was on the Monday after the feast of the Archangel Michael. Now the folk from the country north of the Curlieus expected that the men of Clanrickard would be with them in provisioning the castle, but they were not; only Macwilliam with a small body of horse came as far as Ballintober to meet them. Here they came near to flinching, since the Clanrickard had not sent the army they had promised, but Mac Donnchada said he would never withdraw till he either perished or provisioned the castle, and he bade Macwilliam remain where he was, seeing that he was not strong enough to fight or tackle the Connachtmen. “And,” said he, “if I am killed, I should like you to be alive to nourish my children.” Thereupon he led the way, nor did he pause in that forward rush till he reached Roscommon, and they provisioned the castle, losing only one warrior, and his body they brought away with them.

Against them gathered, in a large host, Toirrdelbach son of Tadc O Briain, king of Thomond, Mac Con Mara, Clanrickard and the Sil Aeda. The Earl took his army through Belach na Fadbaige to Belach an Gamna and came to a very strong wooden bridge that O Briain had made over the Shannon. This he broke down and remained for a night encamped in the country, while O Briain, that same night, pitched a camp beside him. Next day the Earl drew up his army, putting the Galls and Gaels p.617 of Munster in the van and the Meath Galls in the rear. O Domnaill and his few followers dismounted and mingled with the Galls [of the rearguard.] They took the short way through Monabraher to Limerick and this army of the Sil mBriain attacked the Galls, killing the Baron de Kent and Barnewell of Crickstown and many other great people not here enumerated.

Nor were the success and happiness that attended him to be wondered at, for he was the biggest and most handsome man of his age; and though great were his body and his courage he had an equal measure of nobility, of bountifulness and of lordly qualities of every kind, such as wisdom and honour, charitableness and humanity, law and governance, repressing of vice and exalting of virtue. Indeed we think it not too much to say that there never came a lord of the posterity of Niall Noigiallach who, while not having all Ireland in his power, yet came nearer to the Kingship of Ireland than did this lord, on account of his power and estate, form and feature, nobility and bounty, the excellence of his rule, his stoutness of heart towards his enemies and manifold acquaintance with the arts. Moreover it was thought and widely believed, according to the prophecies of the Saints and the likely signs that appeared in him and in his time, that he was that Aed Engach whose coming late in time the prophets and seers and great learned Saints of Ireland had promised; and since he was not, I do not think [that Aed] will come till the day of doom and the end of the world. Yet there is no doubt that if the Gaels had not been growing feeble and fickle he would have made a bid for the sovereignty of Ireland, and it is probable he would have succeeded; but since he saw that the Gaels were becoming men of bad faith, trusting no man, unruly and froward, he made an alliance with the King of England, so that he was not oppressed by the might of the Galls p.705 but held sway in Leth Chuind without cavil, after the manner of the men of Ireland. For many a time he made hosting round every territory therein and carried back, unopposed by them, their pledges and hostages to his own land, just as the kings of whom the poets and the Regnal Successions speak took [the like] to Cruachu or Emain or Ailech. Nor was any part of his success a matter for wonder, for he was the son of a married couple, a true and worthy heir to the land, and there were united in him naturally the goodness of his parents and his own goodness and Aed O Domnaill was “a vessel twice filled”; in so much that the four elements were never in latter times in Ireland put together to form any person more perfect in the qualities of lordship and all other virtues than was O Domnaill, that is Aed Dub son of Aed Ruad, head-letter and guardian of Cenel Conaill, the like of Conn Cetchathach for making war and raising battle and strife, co-equal of Art Enfher in bounty and fidelity, image of Cairbre in proficiency and understanding of all arts in use among the Gaels, peer of Guaire son of Colman for succouring poets and exiles, veritable worthy kinsman of Brian Boruma mac Ceinneididh both in lineage and in actions, such as the exalting of Orders and churchmen, destroying rebels and lawless men, attacking and conquering his foes; and as God bestowed these great gifts upon him in the world, so may his soul enter into rest in God's Kingdom after quitting this life. It was on the fifth of July and a Thursday he died in the monastery of Donegal, where he had put on the robe of St. Francis by his own free decision and consent and being of sound mind, and departed this life after the Unction and Penance prescribed by the Church. His son Magnus O Domnaill was made king in his stead, as was his right, by permission and advice of the Cenel Conaill and the coarbs of St. Columba.",
